# World-Bank-API-Analysis-UI
Program provides users with statistics about certain countries by retreiving information from the World Bank API and displaying it on a User Interface using various charts. Enter "Curtis" in Username and "Ackland" in Password to gain access to the main UI of the program.

After accessing the main UI, dropdowns are provided to select different options in which data you would like to see. After the settings are chosen, the neccessary data is retreived from the World bank API and is processed into viewable graphs.

This project uses Java Swing for the UI and JFreeChart for the graphs.

This Project was done in collaboration with: Evan Goldrick, Calvin Nguyen, and David Lin
